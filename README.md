Working on something


What's Up Everyone!!

My name is DSAX, I'm looking to take my skills to another level, by adding Web design or coding, maybe both.  It looks like this is the new skill to have along with good old fashion technical support background.  I'll be starting off with HTML, CSS and Java Script.

The fun has just begain.
